Configuring and building a new firmware
=======================================

Pre-requisites
--------------

To compile and to run the project, some dependencies need to be installed.
Please check the :ref:`dependencies` section to fetch them.

Fetch the project files
-----------------------

Once the dependencies are installed, create a working directory and then fetch
the project with ``repo``: ::

   mkdir disco407
   cd disco407
   repo init -u https://github.com/wookey-project/manifest.git -m disco407.xml
   repo sync

The ``disco407.xml`` is called a *manifest file*. It is
used to deploy a complete image of the SDK by cloning multiple git repositories
depending on this profile.

Set the environment
-------------------

Then, set some needed environment variables by sourcing the
``setenv.sh`` script ::

   . setenv.sh

The following table shows the variables set by this script.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Description
   * - ``ADA_RUNTIME``
     - Path to the Ada cross-toolchain installation.
   * - ``ST_FLASH``
     - Path to the *st-flash* binary, used to flash the device.
       Needed by the *make burn* target.
   * - ``ST_UTIL``
     - To the *st-link* binary, which can be useful to get
       informational infos about the board
   * - ``CROSS_COMPILE``
     - Prefix used by the C cross-compiler
   * - ``USE_LLVM``
     - **Experimental feature**. Compile with LLVM instead of GCC.
       Not fully operational, mostly used for debugging purpose
       (scan-build for code checking).
   * - ``CLANG_PATH``
     - Replace gcc with clang
   * - ``JAVA_SC_SDK``
     - Path to the Java SmartCard Globalplatform Software Development Kit root
       directory.

.. hint::
   Take a look at the ``setenv.sh`` script, which is highly documented

Most of the time, the paths proposed in this script are not the ones you use in
your specific installation. 
If you need to overload some of these variables, you should not directly edit
the ``setenv.sh`` script. Instead, create a ``setenv.local.sh`` file in the
same directory and set the variables in this file.  

Once you have set your environment variables in your ``setenv.local.sh``
script, just source the ``setenv.sh`` script as described above.


Configure the target
--------------------

To list the predefined configuration profiles, use the *defconfig\_list* target: ::

   make defconfig_list

If you get an error message like '*m_config.mk: Recursive variable
'CROSS_COMPILE' references itself*', check that you have sourced
the ``setenv.sh`` file as explained above.
Then, you can select a configuration profile: ::

   make <defconfig_file>

For example: ::

   $ make defconfig_list
   LISTDEFS   defconfig_list
   boards/32f407disco/configs/disco_blinky_ada_defconfig
   boards/32f407disco/configs/disco_blinky_defconfig
   boards/32f407disco/configs/disco_blinky_ipc_ada_defconfig
   boards/32f407disco/configs/disco_blinky_ipc_defconfig
   boards/32f407disco/configs/disco_svctests_ada_defconfig
   $ make boards/32f407disco/configs/disco_blinky_ipc_ada_defconfig

Then, to customize the profile, run *menuconfig*: ::

   make menuconfig

.. warning::
   When customizing the profile with *menuconfig*, beware
   of the possible inconsistencies leading to non-working configurations!


Build the firmware
------------------

Simply run: ::

   make

The project and the whole documentation are built in the directory set by the
``CONFIG_BUILD_DIR`` variable in the ``.config`` file.

.. hint::
   Building the documentation has a specific target ``make doc``

This directory holds two files: ``<boardname>.hex`` and ``<boardname>.bin``.
The first file is the firmware in *Intel HEX* format, with a plain memory layout filling to
avoid any ambiguity and signature failure.
The second file is the same one, directly in binary format.

Both formats can be used by usual JTAG clients such as *openocd* or *st-flash*.
See :ref:`flash` section for more information about flashing a device for the
first time.


Build the applets
-----------------

.. warning:: Required only for the whole WooKey project relying on an external
             token, but not for the demo examples described in section :ref:`demo`

Install extra-dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The applets sources are hosted in the ``javacard/`` directory.
In order to compile JavaCard applets, you will need various tools:

   * A *JavaCard SDK* (specific to Globalplatform Javacard environment). This JDK
     can be found on the Oracle website, or you can download them for Linux here:
    https://github.com/martinpaljak/oracle_javacard_sdks

   * A *Java SDK*, that provides a Java compiler. *OpenJDK 8u191* or greater should work, but
   please beware of possible compatibility issues between the JDK and the Javacard SDK (see below).
   You can find a compatibility matrix here: https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard/wiki/Version-compatibility
   By default, our applets use the JC303 (3.0.3) SDK, which is only compatible with JDK-8 and JDK-11.

   * Two jars:
     * ``ant-javacard.jar``
     * ``gb.jar``

To use a precompiled version of ``ant-javacard.jar`` and ``gb.jar``,
you can directly download them from: ::

   cd javacard/applet
   wget https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard/releases/download/19.03.04/ant-javacard.jar
   wget https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/releases/download/19.01.22/gp.jar

If you prefer to compile them from the sources, you first need to install
*maven* and the *maven surefire test* framework. Then: ::

   make -C externals gp
   make -C externals antjavacard

This will generate the two jar files and will copy them in the
``javacard/applet`` directory.

Compile the applets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To compile the applets: ::

   make javacard_compile
   make javacard_push

You might have an error like this one:

*Error [...] you have asked to use one smartcard per token.Please insert a
virgin token*

The reason is that by default, the menuconfig is configured so that we use
a dedicated smart card for each cryptographic usage (this is the preferred scenario
for enhanced security). You can however use a single
smart card by unsetting the following option in menuconfig ::

  Secure tokens configuration  ---> Use a dedicated (different) physical smartcard
                                    for each token type (AUTH/DFU/<SIG>)

.. warning:: Using a single smartcard is not recommended for security reasons.
             It is always a good practice to segregate the cryptographic usage,
             hence three tokens in three different physical smart cards (one for
             user authentication, one for DFU, one for firmware signature)

Sign and encrypt the firmware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When generating DFU images (i.e. updates for an existing board, which will be
downloaded through the firmware DFU mode), you will need to use a subset of the
overall firmware. The overall firmware contains the two banks (FLIP and FLOP
images) and the bootloader. The DFU images contain only one of the banks.

Singing is done using the *sign* target of the Makefile with options: ::

   make sign tosign=flip:flop version=1.0.1.0

This target will generate, aside the <boardname>.hex, the following files:

   * flip_fw.hex, flip_fw.bin, flip_fw.bin.signed
   * flop_fw.hex, flop_fw.bin, flop_fw.bin.signed

The *.signed* images are encrypted and include a signed header holding all the
necessary informations about the file (CRC32, calculated HASH, version number,
and so on). They are generated with the 1.0 version.

.. hint::
   The version field is made of four uint8_t fields 'a.b.c.d': 'a' is the 
   major field, 'b' is the minor field, 'c' is the patch field, 'd' is an
   subpatch field. You can also provide the version in the form of an
   equivalent uint32_t (concatenation of a/b/c/d)
  
.. warning::
   Beware of the strict anti-rollback policy enforced by WooKey DFU mode
   when generating signed firmwares
 

This file can be directly used by any DFU tool to update the target, such as
standard dfu-util package. For instance, to upload the signed FLIP
firmware to the target in DFU mode: ::

  dfu-util -D flip_fw.bin.signed


.. hint::
   The 'sign' target of the Makefile takes advanced features options such as
   a 'magic' value included in the firmware header (for future use), and more
   importantly a 'chunk size' that represents the cryptographic block size
   requiring a new key derivation by the DFU token. The smaller this chunk is,
   the more interactions with the DFU token are made (at the expense of update
   time)

.. hint::
   There is an optional 'verify' target that allows to decrypt and check the signature
   of the generated firmwares on a PC using the DFU token (and a PC/SC stack through
   py-scard): ``make verify toverify=flip:flop``. This target also shows information
   (version and so on) of signed binary images
    

Build the documentation
-----------------------

If you wish to build **all** the documentation, you can execute the *doc*
target: ::

   make doc

This will build the following content:

   * The sphinx website (including all the documentation, helpers, principles
     and security explanations)
   * The man pages of the kernel and libstd API
   * The Doxygen-generated datasheets, less readable than sphinx but including
     all the API and structures.

You can also build only the sphinx website if you prefer not to install doxygen
and the (heavy) LaTeX backend with the following command: ::

   make -C doc sphinx
