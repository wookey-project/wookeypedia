The WooKey project
=====================

Context
-------
USB devices are nowadays ubiquitous and participate to a wide variety
of use cases. Recent studies have exposed vulnerabilities on the USB implementations,
and among them the BadUSB attacks are a serious threat against the integrity of USB devices.
Firmwares, hosts Operating Systems, as well as user data confidentiality are at risk.
As a matter of fact, this can have critical consequences knowing that USB mass storage devices are used to transfer
public or confidential data between different machines, including in air gaped networks.

Some proprietary devices are already sold as preventive solutions against the BadUSB class of attacks.
They however lack code or architecture/design review, sometimes yielding in crucial defects.
The academic community has, for its part, focused on the host side by enhancing the Operating
Systems USB sub-module robustness
and by developing filtering proxies. Such approaches,
albeit interesting, can be non-portable and do not protect the USB device itself when it is
lost or falls in the hands of adversaries.

Such limitations inclined us to prototype a secure and trustworthy USB mass storage device.
This documentation compiles the results of this initiative, and provides insight into how we
designed and implemented WooKey using off-the-shelf components under open source and open hardware constraints.


Target usage of WooKey
----------------------

When compiling all the desirable security features that one wants for a
secure USB device, no open source solution seems to offer a comprehensive
answer. Proprietary solutions being out of scope since no architecture and
code review are possible, the WooKey project has emerged. It aims at
prototyping a secure and trusted USB mass storage device featuring user
data encryption and strong user authentication, with fully open source and
open hardware foundations.

We outline the fact that even though the prototype focuses on the mass
storage USB class, all the security concepts we describe and provide
are easily portable to other USB device classes such as HID or CDC.

Beyond the mere USB oriented devices, many defense in depth concepts
and primitives can also be ported and used in **many IoT projects**.

The following sections describe the functional specifications, the
threat model as well as the security expectations.

Functional specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The device must provide classical USB mass storage features with
transparent user data encryption and decryption. It
shall be detected as a thumb drive on any USB host (i.e. any classical
Operating System) with no specific software installation. 

WooKey threat model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We consider that the adversary has logical and/or physical access to the device:

  * The adversary may try to read the data simply by connecting the
    device to a host or by physically reading the mass storage cells, for
    example when the device is lost or stolen. This can be done either
    when the device is powered up, or when it is powered down (which
    corresponds to an attack on the data at rest).
  * The adversary may try to tamper with the device using logical attacks,
    for example when it is connected to an untrusted host. These attacks
    abuse potential weaknesses in protocols used for external communication
    such as the USB stack or the external data storage buses.
  * The adversary may open the device to physically tamper with the
    internal storage, firmware, or any other component present on the
    actual device.
  * We suppose that an external authentication token is used to validate
    the legitimate user presence. We will only consider physical attacks
    where the adversary does not possess the legitimate user PIN code. In
    other words, side-channel and fault injection attacks on the device in
    a post-authentication phase are explicitly out of scope. Such kinds of
    attacks are considered during the pre-authentication phase though, either on the
    device, on the external token, or on the communication channel when
    these two exchange data.

Security expectations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We expect our device to provide the following main security features:

  * User data protection: all data at rest are encrypted, and their confidentiality 
    protected. The data integrity is out of scope.
  * Strong user authentication: the legitimate user must be present when data is decrypted
    (implying a strong user authentication). When a user PIN code is used, attack vectors 
    that can steal it must be limited.
  * Secure device software update: the deviceâ€™s software should be robustly upgradable
    for system maintenance (e.g. security patches). Update files must be authenticated and 
    integrity checked with no rollback to (possibly buggy) old versions. A software upgrade
    must be a voluntary and authenticated action. The firmware updates must be reliable with
    no possible platform bricking.
  * Firmware robustness against software attacks: the firmware should guarantee that an adversary
    attacking the exposed software surface (on the USB bus for instance) is not able to get a privileged access
    to the platform, and does not gain access to critical material such
    as sensitive cryptographic keys. Software attacks must be confined in
    unprivileged and isolated containers.

The WooKey architecture
------------------------

Hardware design rationale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The functional and security inputs of the WooKey specifications lead to
natural design choices and/or requirements when it comes to the hardware platform.

First, the processor at the heart of the design must embed a Memory Protection 
Unit (MPU), as well as a cryptographic acceleration to guarantee fast user data encryption.

In order to achieve good performance on the USB side, the controller must
be compatible with the USB High Speed (USB 2.0) specification.

A strong user authentication mechanism must be provided through
the usage of an external token, which securely embeds the sensitive master
keys of the platform.

The firmware must remain authentic during the
life-cycle of the product, and only updated through controlled means:
debug functionalities provided by the SoC manufacturer such as Joint
Test Action Group (JTAG) or Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interfaces must
be reliably deactivated.

Since the platform design has been thought to be open source, all components and
their data-sheets must be publicly available. The platform should have a
good security versus price ratio in order to allow large-scale deployment.
We detail in the next sections the rationale behind our specific choices
for the hardware components.

On the MCU side, we focused on the STM32F439 as it fits most of our needs.
Moreover, the Cortex-M4 SoCs have been widely studied in the recent
years, and the STM32F439 features a cryptographic coprocessor (the CRYP
engine) as well as a TRNG (True Random Number Generator).
See https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f429-439.html?querycriteria=productId=LN1806.

Though this SoC has an integrated USB Full Speed PHY (12 Mb/s capable),
it needs an external PHY to achieve High Speed (480 Mb/s). The
communication between the SoC and the PHY is done using ULPI, which is
a standardized interface for USB 2.0.

We have chosen to store the encrypted user data on external SD cards.
This format has many advantages. It offers large storage capacities for an
affordable cost with a possible expansion of the USB thumb drive capacity
by switching the SD modules. Compared to raw flash modules, there is
no need to handle complex FTL (Flash Translation Layer) software layers
(the firmware embedded in the SD card takes care of this).

A strong user authentication ensures that no sensitive cryptographic
operation is performed without the legitimate user presence (through a
correct PIN code). This implies that all the cryptographic and authentication
material must be handled securely: a secure element seems to be a suitable
choice for this task. Splitting the platform and the user authentication
material yields in a strong two-factor authentication scheme. This is why
we have chosen to use an external and extractable user token (instead of
soldering it) in the form of a smartcard.
Since Javacard is the only widely available framework to offer a Common Criteria
certification, we have chosen to focus on this platform. More specifically,
we have developed and tested our applets on EAL 4 certified NXP JCOP J3D081
2.4.2 smartcard.

In order to limit the smartcard PIN code exposition and defeat Man In
The Middle Attack on the USB bus or in a compromised host, we
have decided to include a user input interface directly on the platform.
This allows confining the PIN in the WooKey device. We have chosen the
SPI based TFT-LCD ILI9341 with a AD7843 touch screen component, allowing
a randomized PIN pad that makes movements observation attacks more complex.

Software design rationale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Classical USB thumb drives need at least two main software components:
the USB stack to exchange data with the host and the mass storage manager
to store data. One of WooKey main features is to encrypt the data at
rest, which requires a dedicated cryptographic module to encrypt/decrypt
this data for performance reasons. WooKey must securely manage both the cryptographic and
authentication materials along the user data path.

The data path goes through three logical modules to read and write
data from/into the device:

   * The USB module handles the USB communication with the host.
   * The SD module manages the mass storage device and read/write of encrypted data.
   * The cryptographic module sits between these two modules. It encrypts/decrypts
     data when the authentication has been performed using the external token.

The CRYP hardware module increases the cryptographic operations
performance: processing an AES block takes very few cycles, and the
engine allows DMA (Direct Memory Access) transactions with the other
modules (USB and SDIO).

Since we want the encryption and decryption along the data path to be very efficient during USB
and SDIO transfers, we must avoid a reconfiguration of the AES CRYP
engine (and a key schedule) at each transaction while preventing the
USB and SDIO tasks to steal and leak the sensitive data encryption
key. Fortunately, we can isolate the registers configuring and holding
the AES key using the MPU. This yields in the following split of the
WooKey cryptographic task in two modules:

   * An untrusted cryptographic module: it shares memory space with the USB and SDIO tasks,
     and its job is to trigger AES CBC encryption and decryption in the CRYP and handle DMA transfers. This module
     uses the CRYP with the key already setup, and never accesses the secret value.
   * A trusted cryptographic module: this module is confined and isolated
     from the other tasks. It is in charge of setting up the CRYP key registers
     with the secret AES key derived from the external authentication token.
     It is also in charge of managing all the communication with this token.

The trusted cryptographic module communicates with the external smartcard through
the ISO-7816-3 layer, with APDUs. The main SoC and the token embed
(personalized) Elliptic Curve Cryptography ECDSA key pairs. The first
thing that is performed by the two peers when the token is inserted is
a mutual authentication. This is performed with an ephemeral ECDH
(Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman), and deriving AES-CTR and HMAC-SHA-256
session keys, as well as a random IV (Initialization Vector)
value. This allows us to establish a secure channel with confidentiality,
integrity and anti-replay properties. Forcing a mutual authentication
as a mandatory first step allows to limit the attack surface (with
malicious tokens or a malicious ISO-7816 master).

The WooKey project challenges
-----------------------------

Security versus performance: incompatible?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integrating high security properties in both hardware and software design
impact the overall performance.

The software architecture, based on a microkernel with various security
features such as WâŠ•X protection, MPU-based partitioning and full userspace
drivers and stacks including secure DMA usage inherently generates performance
impact in comparison to basic bare metal implementations.

In the software design of WooKey, based on the EwoK microkernel, all drivers are executed
in userspace, including their associated Interrupts Service Routines (ISR).

Any DMA request is controlled by the kernel as DMA controllers are never mapped in userspace.
This is the consequence of two constraints:

   * DMA controllers host multiple streams which associated registers are interlaced, making
     per-stream memory mapping impossible.
   * A direct access to DMA address registers is an open security hole, giving a task the ability
     to copy from or move to any part of the memory without any control from the kernel.

ISR are also executed in userspace as they are a part of user applications, and may be corrupted
through the corresponding application attack surface. As a consequence, they can't be executed in
handler mode but have to be executed as a user dedicated thread, with the corresponding task
permission and memory mapping.

All these restrictions have an impact on the overall user drivers performance. Nevertheless,
an efficient kernel implementation and optimized security integration should allow to keep decent
performance for such embedded devices.

First benchmarks on alpha versions of userland drivers (CRYP, SDIO and USB) have shown very encouraging
performance results, with a reasonable difference with the bare-metal versions of these drivers. This
tends to show that the EwoK microkernel and our choices (userland ISR paradigm, fast DMA control, etc.)
are promising.

We will share these results and the userland drivers **very soon** (see the release roadmap below) along
with the open hardware design of the WooKey board.

.. _roadmap:

The WooKey release roadmap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The WooKey project involves many software modules: the EwoK microkernel, userland drivers handling
many devices (USARTs, USB, SDIO, CRYP, etc.), userland libraries handling multiple functions with more or
less hardware adherence, and finally high level userland applications providing the functionalities of the
encrypting USB thumb drive. Wrapping all this, the Tataouine SDK manages to mix all these software modules
together to produce a firmware. Finally, the sources of the open hardware dedicated board are also part of
the project.

Due to the richness, modularity and diversity of all these software modules (and hardware modules), we have scheduled
the WooKey project release in two steps with two major milestones (see the roadmap below):

  * A first milestone with `Embedded Recipes 2018 <https://embedded-recipes.org/2018/talk/wookey-the-usb-battlefront-warrior/>`_,
    mainly focused on the EwoK microkernel and the Tataouine SDK. A first version of EwoK is released along with
    two basic userland applications that serve as entry point examples on how to interact with it. Since these two
    examples interact with leds and the console, the USART driver as well as some libraries are provided as helpers
    to the applications. The firmware build targets the STM32 based ST Discovery F407 board.
  * A second milestone in January 2019 providing all the other components of the WooKey project, including the
    hardware schematics of the WooKey board.

Between these two milestones, the WooKey project will of course move forward and will mainly focus on integrating and
fine tuning all the userland drivers and libraries to fulfill the full project release date. Some drivers and libraries might
also be released between these two milestones, with standalone applications using them.
