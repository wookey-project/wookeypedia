sys_yield
---------
EwoK time slot releasing API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Synopsis
""""""""

There is some time where yielding is an efficient way to optimize the scheduling. Historically, yield() is a collaborative syscall requesting the end of the
current slot, asking for the scheduling of a new task. In embedded system, such
call may help the scheduler in optimize the task execution by voluntary reduce
a task's slot when no more execution is required.

sys_yield()
"""""""""""

.. note::
   Syncrhonous syscall, **not** executable in ISR mode as an ISR as no reason to yield

In EwoK, all tasks main thread can yield. When this happend, the task's thread
will not be scheduled again until an external event requires its execution.
Such external event can be:

   * An IRQ registered by the task. When the ISR is executed, the task main thread is runnable again
   * An IPC targeting the task is sent by another task

The yield syscall has the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_yield()

.. warning::
   Using sys_yield is a requirement when using RMA scheduling scheme, to avoid starvation.
